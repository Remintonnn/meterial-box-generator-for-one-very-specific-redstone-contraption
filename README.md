Welcome to the meterial-box-generator-for-one-very-specific-redstone-contraption repo, MBGFOVSRC for short,
this is a script that converts map art nbt file into a meterial layout that can be process by the map making redstone machine.

the machine is not out yet since I have to unlazy myself and make a video or just publish it somehow,
I just post the code here so I can check that off the list.

# How to get this thing on my PC
just clone this repo and run the main.py using python 3.12, other version is untested but maybe it can work,
for the non-stinky-nerds here is the [EXE download page](https://www.google.com),
just replace main.py to the EXE file name in the useage section,
tho you can't change the settings if you run it that way as you need to do that via changing the script.
# Useage

the .schem and .nbt conversion seems to broke in 1.21 version of litematica and all shulker box inside chest will be empty when loaded, so far the workaround is to paste the .schem file in single player using worldEdit then save it again using litematica or worldEdit.
